I'm a battery engineer turned data scientist & software developer focused on building reliable data and software systems.

I enjoy working across the stack: data modeling, pipelines, backend services, and the presentation layer. I value pragmatism, boring tech for core workflows, and strong typing / schemas to reduce ambiguity.

## Interests

- Data platform architecture & reproducibility
- ML system reliability & evaluation
- Type-safe interfaces between services
- Developer experience & tooling

## Background

I started in battery engineering—designing tests, managing experimental data, and automating analysis. That pushed me toward building internal tools, then full software systems that automated large swaths of manual scientific workflows. Over time the ratio shifted from domain engineering to software & data.

## Current Focus

I'm currently refining a personal stack combining: Hugo + lightweight JS for the site layer, Python + DuckDB for analytics experiments, and Go/TypeScript for services. My goal: fast feedback loops with durable artifacts.

## Principles

1. Favor composable text-based artifacts (code, markdown, notebooks—versioned) over opaque UIs.
2. Make the invisible visible (metrics, lineage, validation gates).
3. Prefer explicit contracts and schemas.
4. Optimize for readability first; performance second (until it matters).
